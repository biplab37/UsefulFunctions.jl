# UsefulFunctions.jl

This Package contains some of the useful functions that I often use in my code. Having all of them in a separate package increases code reusability and make code more concise.

## Usage

Add the package using `Pkg`

```julia-repl
]add https://github.com/biplab37/UsefulFunctions.jl
```
then start using it

```julia-repl
using UsefulFunctions
```
