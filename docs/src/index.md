# Useful Functions
---

A package containing some of the functions that I regularly use in my code. Not an exhaustive list. But I use this package as a dependency in many of my other bigger projects.

## Installation
To install the package, use the following command in the Julia REPL:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/biplab37/UsefulFunctions.jl")
```
or press `]` to enter the package manager and run:
```
add https://github.com/biplab37/UsefulFunctions.jl
```
